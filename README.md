# A script for enabling sound on startup on X server (mine will play the intel logo sound)

first download a favorite sound and place it in `/usr/share/sounds/`
you'll have to download "mpv" to make it work
after it place `startup_sound` script in `/usr/bin/`
and then place the service in `/etc/systemd/system/` and enable the service.

that's it :)
